# WebScrapping

In this Project, in order to understand the concept of web scraping using BeautifulSoup in Python, I have written g a python program which will access the IMDB website and then fetch the top rated movies present in the IMDB website and then load this data into an excel file.
IMDB website contains movie ratings but in this program I am only interested in scraping the top rated movies of all time only.

In order to load data into an excel file, I have used openpyxl module. Using openpyxl, it is very easy to create a new excel file and then rename the sheet name and then load data into the excel file. 

I have installed Requests module and Beautiful Soup module using the pip installer.  If you are using windows then you need to run the pip install command from command prompt using the command as “pip install module_name”.
